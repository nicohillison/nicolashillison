### Hi there!

I'm Nicolas Hillison from San Francsico, CA. I just graduated from Colby College, one of one of the premier liberal arts schools in the nation, with a major in computer science and a minor in statistics. I enjoy learning languages such as R, SQL, and Python. I also enjoy learning about libraries that are strongly correlated to data analytics and data visualizations such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Shiny.
