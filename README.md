# Hi there üëã, I'm Nicolas Hillison
I'm Nicolas Hillison from San Francisco, CA. I just graduated from Colby College, one of the premier liberal arts schools in the nation, with a major in computer science and a minor in statistics. I enjoy learning coding languages and libraries that are strongly correlated to data analytics and visualizations.

## Projects
- **R**:
  - Improving Maine Food Pantries (*Fall 2023*): Conducted a detailed group analysis report and presentation, the main goal was to better understand the needs and reasons why people in central Maine use food pantries. By looking at the numbers and statistics, we aimed to improve and optimize the services offered by these food pantries in the state. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Maine-Food-Shelter-Improvements.
  - Independent Study (*Spring 2023*): Developed a dynamic application analysis report leveraging Shiny, aimed at uncovering company trends and charting their trajectory towards IPO status. This analysis was conducted using Crunchbase data to provide an interactive exploration of key insights into companies' journeys within the business landscape. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Independent-Study.
  - Decreasing Homelessness (*Fall 2022*): Conducted multivariate data analysis aimed at identifying patterns to mitigate homelessness in Maine, specifically for the Mid-Maine Homelessness Shelter (MMHS). The culmination of this project resulted in a comprehensive poster presentation and an interactive application. These deliverables offered practical insights and actionable steps for shelters to enhance their services for the homeless community. The poster was formally presented to the Mayor of Waterville, ME, and the board of the Mid-Maine Homelessness Shelter (MMHS). Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Success-in-Stable-Housing.
  - Average Price of a Car (*Spring 2022*): Conducted analysis on multiple time-based datasets and developed two distinct models to predict the average price of cars in correlation with both fuel economy and drive type. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Average-Price-of-Car.
  - Owning a Bird (*Spring 2022*): Examined the correlation among datasets to predict whether there is a relationship between lung cancer patients and their likelihood of owning a bird. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Owning-a-Bird.
  - The Effects of Exercise on Happiness (*Fall 2021*): Conducted an initial analysis by constructing a statistical model to determine if there is a correlation between regular exercise among Colby College students and their level of happiness as compared to those who do not engage in regular exercise. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Exercise-vs-Happiness.
- **SQL**:
  - Social News Aggregator (*Summer 2022*): Using semantic analysis, identified misinformation and disinformation from social media feeds by creating a schema. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Social-News-Aggregator/tree/main.
  - Deforestation Exploration (*Summer 2022*): Conducted ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù analysis on global forest datasets to determine environmental impacts around the world from 1990 to 2016. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Deforestation-Exploration/tree/main.
- **HTML/JS**:
  - Interactive Dashboard (*Summer 2023*): Developed interactive dashboards and individual graphs utilizing the JavaScript library ApexCharts. These visualizations were crafted with a dynamic, user-friendly interface, and they were populated with a randomized dataset. The interactivity was designed to enhance user engagement within a secure, private browser environment. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Data-Dashboards-With-ApexCharts.
- **Python**:
  - Data Analytics and Visualization (*Spring 2021*): Created a Python class called¬†Data¬†that will extract data from a CSV file. Then, I used the numpy Python library to perform computations on numeric data, selected and organized by variable name and used the matplotlib Python library to create various visualizations. Lastly, I used the tools I implemented to analyze a real-world dataset of my choice. I practiced common operations that will come up throughout my data analytics career. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization.
  - Categorical and Exploratory Data Analysis (*Spring 2021*): Running statistical analyses and plotting Numpy ndarray data by reading CSV files, storing data, as well as accessing and filtering data by variable name. This led to be able to perform projects, translations, rotations, and scaling operations on Numpy ndarray data. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Categorical-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.
  - Linear Regression (*Spring 2021*): implement an analysis pipeline to apply and interpret linear regression on Iris and other datasets. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Linear-Regression.
  - Clustering and Image Segmentation (*Spring 2021*): Implementing the K-means clustering algorithm for clustering data (performing unsupervised learning). Testing and plotting K-means clusters with a simple 2D dataset, then using the algorithm to compress the colorspace of images and segment regions with similar colors. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Clustering.
  - Spam Email Classification (*Spring 2021*): Implementing an email spam filter to determine whether an email is spam (spam) or not (ham). This is done by implementing and comparing the performance of two supervised learning algorithms: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes. Working with the Enron spam email dataset (~34,000 emails). After training the classifiers on the email data, I used the models to predict whether the new email was spam or ham. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Spam-Email-Classification.
  - Neural Networks and Handwriting Recognition (*Spring 2021*): Implementing a neural network and using it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset: my network will predict which numeric digit 0-9 is contained in the test images that I present it. I will use radial basis functions (RBF) in the neural network hidden layer (RBF network). Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Neural-Networks-and-Handrwiting-Recognition.
