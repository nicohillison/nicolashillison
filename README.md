## Projects
- **R**:
  - Improving Maine Food Pantries (*Fall 2023*): Conducted a detailed group analysis report and presentation, the main goal was to better understand the needs and reasons why people in central Maine use food pantries. By looking at the numbers and statistics, we aim to improve and optimize the services offered by these food pantries in the state. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Maine-Food-Shelter-Improvements.
  - Independent Study (*Spring 2023*): Created an interactive application analysis report using Shiny to find company trends and their path toward IPO status using Crunchbase data. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Independent-Study.
  - Decreasing Homelessness (*Fall 2022*): Executed multivariate data analysis to identify patterns to decrease homelessness in Maine for the Mid-Maine Homelessness Shelter (MMHS). The final project demonstrated a poster as well as an interactive application with practical insights and action steps for shelters to improve their services to the homeless. The poster was presented to the Mayor of Waterville, ME, and the board of the Mid-Maine Homelessness Shelter (MMHS). Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Success-in-Stable-Housing.
  - Average Price of a Car (*Spring 2022*): Ran analysis on multiple time-based data sets creating two different models to predict the average price of a car in association with fuel economy as well as drive type. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Average-Price-of-Car.
  - Owning a Bird (*Spring 2022*): Analyzed the correlation amongst data sets predicting if lung cancer patients were apt to own a bird. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Owning-a-Bird.
  - The Effects of Exercise on Happiness (*Fall 2021*): Performed a preliminary analysis by creating a statistical model that would help figure out if Colby College students who exercised regularly are happier than those who do not. Here is the repository for this project: https://github.com/nicohillison/Exercise-vs-Happiness.
