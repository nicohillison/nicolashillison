I'm Nicolas Hillison from San Francsico, CA. I just graduated from Colby College, one of one of the premier liberal arts schools in the nation, with a major in computer science and a minor in statistics. I enjoy learning coding languages and libraries that are strongly correlated to data analytics and visualizations.

Skills: R / SQL / Python / HTML / Excell / Matplotlib / Pandas / NumPy / SciPy / Shiny
